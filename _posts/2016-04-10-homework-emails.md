<h2>The Situation</h2>
In primary schools where teachers only have a single class to educate, sharing or publishing homework is quite manageable. On the other hand, secondary schools, where teachers have up to 15 classes per week, would create far too much work to sustain over an entire term or year.

Many primary schools have finally embraced their online presence, now with weekly homework published to dedicated class webpages including any literacy/numeracy exercises or group spellings.

However, it's easy to forget to check the webpage regularly for the latest homework and can be cumbersome locating the correct page to access the specific document, often a PDF or Word Document.
<h2>The Solution</h2>
It wouldn't be hard to setup a class mailing list where new documents are published. There is already a mailing system in place for school newsletters so the architecture is available.

By extending the mailing list to select any classes for your child(ren), the class teachers can then easily issue homework by email. This will ensure parents are aware of what their child should be doing, ideally with specific deadlines.

Email reminders could even be configured for the day before, prompting parents to check whether their child has completed all their exercises.

Going further, reminders could be distributed by calendar subscriptions (available in all <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.icloud.com/calendar">Apple</a> and <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Calendar-in-Outlook-on-the-web-for-business-5219c457-d1fe-4c2f-9032-1a816b88e936">Microsoft</a> office solutions). Regular events are automatically placed in your calendar along with the homework brief or spellings with suitable reminder notifications configured.
