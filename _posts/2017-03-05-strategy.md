We are now sharing our organisation roadmap publicly on <a href="https://trello.com/b/uJJMFTkl/progressing">Trello</a>.

We believe in an open strategy to our ongoing efforts, allowing others to see what we have planned for the future and how that might be delivered. We encourage others to contribute and help shape the way we deliver our strategy, what is important to the education sector, and how technology can help to influence that. Combined together, “edtech” is something we can all embrace and support generations of learners.

Follow <a href="https://trello.com/b/uJJMFTkl/progressing">our public board</a> for all the ideas we have planned and help decide the future of Progressing.
