We are now sharing our organisationÂ roadmap publicly on <a href="https://trello.com/b/uJJMFTkl/progressing">Trello</a>.

We believe in an open strategy to our ongoing efforts, allowing others to see what we have planned for the future and how that might be delivered.

Follow <a href="https://trello.com/b/uJJMFTkl/progressing">our public board</a> for all the ideas we have planned and help decide the future of Progressing.
