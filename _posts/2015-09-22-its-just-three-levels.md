All educational flight paths are built on the same foundational points of entry (dare we say "levels"?)
<ol>
	<li>Higher prior attainer</li>
	<li>Middle prior attainer</li>
	<li>Lower prior attainer</li>
</ol>
From that, you can ascertain whether a pupil is:
<ol>
	<li>Working towards expected</li>
	<li>At expected</li>
	<li>Working at greater than expected</li>
</ol>
It's all very similar to typical performance metrics in the professional industry:
<ol>
	<li>Meeting expectations</li>
	<li>Exceeding expectations</li>
	<li>Above and beyond</li>
</ol>
This pattern is well versed throughout personal development irrelevant of the person's age or level. By simplifying the levels into three clear tiers, it allows the person to easily self assess where they think they're performing and, ideally, compare with peer or senior reviews.

<strong>Next time you're looking at your group's levels, make sure you adopt the three tier system.</strong>
