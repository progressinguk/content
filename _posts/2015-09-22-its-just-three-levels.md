<p>All educational flight paths are built on the same foundational points of entry (dare we say &#8220;levels&#8221;?)</p>
<ol>
<li>Higher prior attainer</li>
<li>Middle prior attainer</li>
<li>Lower prior attainer</li>
</ol>
<p>From that, you can ascertain whether a pupil is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Working towards expected</li>
<li>At expected</li>
<li>Working at greater than expected</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s all very similar to typical performance metrics in the professional industry:</p>
<ol>
<li>Meeting expectations</li>
<li>Exceeding expectations</li>
<li>Above and beyond</li>
</ol>
<p>This pattern is well versed throughout personal development irrelevant of the person&#8217;s age or level. By simplifying the levels into three clear tiers, it allows the person to easily self assess where they think they&#8217;re performing and, ideally, compare with peer or senior reviews.</p>
<p><strong>Next time you&#8217;re looking at your group&#8217;s levels, make sure you adopt the three tier system.</strong></p>
