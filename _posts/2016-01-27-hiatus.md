<p>Following a (slightly longer than planned) Summer break, we&#8217;ve decided to restore this project with a number of different initiatives.</p>
<p>First off, this website is getting a lick of paint along with some fresh and regular content to outline our plans. Be sure to keep one eye on the blog or, if you prefer, our <a href="https://twitter.com/ProgressingUK">@ProgressingUK Twitter</a> account for updates. (Feel free to say hello and ask any questions you may have.)</p>
<p>Secondly, we are ramping up <a href="http://progressing.co.uk/app/">our app</a> we started developing back in 2014 with a number of teachers focused on personal development. This is a touch-friendly application with a mobile-first approach, suitable for the modern teacher adopting digital technologies where possible.</p>
<p>Finally, we have some training programmes in development to teach the foundations of coding websites with our selection of <a href="http://progressing.co.uk/web-101/">Web 101 courses</a>. These have been refined over the past few years along with our web professionals who have been delivering the content to Prince&#8217;s Trust students.</p>
